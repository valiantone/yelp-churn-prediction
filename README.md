# yelp-churn-prediction

Online communities are growing constantly at a rate where major communities are now at a size comparable to small nations. The information exchanged in these
communities adds to the human store-house of knowledge. The nature of this information is a subject of a great deal of research. The problem we want to focus
on is more pertinent to users in these communities. The knowledge exchange is possible only due to the users who interact and exist as nodes in this gigantic network.
In online communities now-a-days a recurring problem is retaining interest of users and ensuring that users remain active. We propose a novel framework which in-
tegrates a number of models to predict the activity of new or sophomoric user in a multi-interest community namely Yelp. We introduce Topical Influence Models in
Activity prediction which go on to out-perform traditional methods and our baseline by a wide-margin.
